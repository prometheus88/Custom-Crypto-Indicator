This script retrieves the top 50 cryptocurrencies from the CoinGecko API, gathers their 7-day historical price and volume data, and computes a custom indicator (momentum score) using RSI (Relative Strength Index) and cross-correlation. It then creates a rating (Strong Buy, Buy, Neutral, Sell, Strong Sell) based on a custom indicator and saves the results in JSON format. Rate-limiting is implemented to comply with API usage constraints.
